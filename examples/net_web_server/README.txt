HOW TO USE THE EXAMPLE WEB SERVER

  This example hosts a web server on an SD card. Copy the 'www'
  directory included with this example on to your SD card and ensure the
  SD card is hooked up to your STM32.

  Run this example and point your browser at your stm32plus IP address
  (DHCP is used to obtain an IP address, so check your router to find
  the address assigned to stm32plus).

  For example, if your IP address is 192.168.1.10 then the test URL is:

    http://192.168.1.10/www/index.html

  You should see an offline copy of a web page from the wikipedia
  collection.
