/**
 * This example shows how to use two ADC peripherals simultaneously. ADC1 and ADC2 are used
 * to convert channels 0,1 (ADC1) and 2,3 (ADC2) simultaneously. That is, channels 0 and 2
 * are converted at the same time followed by channels 1 and 3. The order of the values in
 * the 4-value output buffer will be channel [0,2,1,3].
 *
 * USART3 remap1 is configured with protocol settings of 57600/8/N/1. The ADC channels are read
 * from PA[0], PA[1], PA[2], PA[3]. You will need to connect these GPIO inputs to valid levels
 * between GND and VREF to see conversion values.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
