/**
 * This example shows how to use the analog watchdog. The analog watchdog allows you to set an acceptable voltage
 * range for one or all of your ADC channels, for example the VBat channel. If the level falls outside the acceptable
 * range then an interrupt is fired. Continuous conversion mode could be used along with interrupts in order to
 * do everything in the background although care must be taken in your code to avoid an infinite interrupt loop.
 *
 * We will set an acceptable range of 750-2500. We will configure DAC1 to output values of 0,1000,2000,3000,4000.
 * The output of DAC1 (PA4) will be connected to the input of ADC1 channel 0 (PA0).
 *
 * Connect the output of DAC1 (PA4) to the input of ADC channel 0 (PA0). Also connect PB6/PB7 to see the test
 * output on USART1.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F0
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F051R8T6
 *   STM32F100RBT6
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
 *   STM32F107VCT6
