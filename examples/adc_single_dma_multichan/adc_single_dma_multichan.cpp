/**
 * This example adds DMA and multi-channel conversion to the mix. We'll use ADC1 to convert
 * three channels plus the internal temperature automatically and in sequence and we'll
 * write out the results to the USART for you to see.
 *
 * On the F0:
 *   The ADC uses the asynchronous 14MHz clock with channel latencies of 28,55,239.
 *
 * On the F1:
 *   The ADC uses PCLK2/6 (e.g. 72MHz/6 = 12MHz) with channel latencies of 7.5,13.5,55.5.
 *
 * On the F4:
 *   The ADC is configured in 'scan mode' which means that it will convert all the
 *   configured channels and, because we are not using continuous mode, it will stop at the end
 *   of the group.
 *
 * The DMA channel for ADC1 is used to move the converted channel data out to SRAM.
 * We configure the 'complete' DMA interrupt to fire when the complete group has
 * finished converting. The converted data is written to the USART, we pause for a second
 * and then do it all again, ad infinitum.
 *
 * USART1 is configured with protocol settings of 57600/8/N/1. The ADC channels are read
 * from PA[0], PA[1], PA[2]. You will need to connect these GPIO inputs to valid levels
 * between GND and VREF to see conversion values.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F0
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F042F6P6
 *   STM32F051R8T6
 *   STM32F100RBT6
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
 *   STM32F107VCT6
