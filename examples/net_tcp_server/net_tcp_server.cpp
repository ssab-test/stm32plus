/**
 * This example demonstrates a TCP 'echo' server. Telnet to this server and type lines of text at it
 * to see them echo'd back. Maximum 100 characters per line, please. Multiple simultaneous connections
 * are supported up to the configured maximum per server. The 'TcpConnectionArray' class takes care of
 * the connection multiplexing for you. All you need to do to run a server is subclass TcpConnection
 * and implement the handleRead(), handleWrite() and handleClose() methods as demonstrated below.
 *
